- how to remove dat-file and close stream if user closes gnuplot by closing the window?

- (more than one gnuplot instance) it would be good to apply commands
  to the other plot-figure if the user focuses to another plot window

- implement other API commands

- implement test

- avoid the (ltk-) warnings when loading the lib; should I implement
  do-execute by myself?

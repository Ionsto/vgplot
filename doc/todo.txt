open tasks:

- (more than one gnuplot instance) it would be good to apply commands
  to the other plot-figure if the user focuses to another plot window

- implement other API commands

- avoid the (ltk-) warnings when loading the lib; should I implement
  do-execute by myself?

- meaningfull error message when running make-doc without cl-api
